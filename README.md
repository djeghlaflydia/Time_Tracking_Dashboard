# Time Tracking Dashboard

## Welcome!

## Overview

The Time Tracking Dashboard is a web application designed to help users manage and track their time effectively across various activities. The dashboard includes options for work, study, play, self-care, social, and exercise. Users can activate or deactivate any of these options, and the dashboard will track the time spent on each activity. This tracking can be viewed on a daily, weekly, and monthly basis.
